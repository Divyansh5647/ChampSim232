### Members: Aditya Nemiwal(210050004), Ashwin Goyal(210050024), Divyansh Singhal(210050045)
On all the traces provided, the following various parameters(or policies) were altered and the resulting changes were observed like IPC or miss rates:

- The size of a single cache block while keeping memory constant
- Size of L1, L2, L3 Caches
- Associativity of Caches
- Function of access latency as the size of cache

The detailed results obtained are reported in the following presentation link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N8Zs5aVaZxt0kvnf_Ilo4hQ3ojCOf8v4WMMcJ9L6qaI/edit?usp=sharing.
