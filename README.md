On all the traces provided, the following various parameters(or policies) were altered and the resulting changes were observed like IPC or miss rates:

- Cache Replacement Policies like LRU, DRRIP, SRRIP
- The size of a single cache block while keeping memory constant
- Size of L1, L2, L3 Caches
- Associativity of Caches
- Function of access latency as the size of cache

The detailed results obtained are reported in the presentation -----------.

To collect and visualise the above required data, python scripts were used which are present in the directory ----------.
